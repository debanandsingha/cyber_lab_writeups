# ðŸ’» cyber_lab_writeups
A curated collection of personal cybersecurity lab writeups from platforms like Hack The Box, TryHackMe, and more. Each writeup documents the full walkthrough of the lab â€” including enumeration, exploitation, privilege escalation, and root flag capture.

The goal of this repository is to share knowledge, reinforce learning, and serve as a reference for future challenges in penetration testing and ethical hacking.
